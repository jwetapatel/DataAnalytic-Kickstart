# Kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
We need to help Louise with her project campaign, and we'll be performing data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects to uncover any hidden trends. 

### Purpose of the project 
Louiseâ€™s play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. With charts and graphs, we will analyze how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges 

### Theater outcome by Launch date

With the existing Kickstarter data, I started analyzing for Louise's crowdfunding campaign in excel. 
To reach to the conclusion first I filter the data based on parent categories and year.
Based on above filtering we analyze the theater outcomes by launch date (i.e., successful, failed or canceled). The graphical presentation is shown as below.

Followed below steps to generate the filter pivot chart : 
 - Create a pivot table from the KickStarter worksheet, and place the pivot table in a new sheet.
- Label the sheet "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date."
- Filter the pivot table based on "Parent Category" and "Years."
- Place the appropriate pivot table fields in the columns, rows, and values.
- Filter the column labels to show only "successful," "failed," and "canceled."

One of the challenge I faced during this exercise is to covert the Unix timestamps in to the date standard format. 

### Outcome based on goals
